# Parkinson-Detection-using-Spiral-Drawings

Finetuned Last 25 Layers of Resnet50 Using my own made Dataset - 85% Accuracy Achieved
The model is pretty easy to understand as it used a custom head for the two classes probabilities. I Made my own dataset which can be found on my kaggle dataset here:

And the model trained can be found here:

Important Note: Data Augmentation is super effective just like i used up 360 degree rotations, horizontal/vertical flips and much more.
